## What We Do

### AI Automation

* **Document & Data Automation:** Extract data from PDFs, invoices, contracts, and emails into structured stores.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Event-driven pipelines using Airflow/Temporal/Zapier/custom APIs.
* **AI Assistants:** LLM copilots for support, ops, analytics, and decisioning.
* **Customer Support Automation:** Smart triage, email responders, and KB assistants.

### Security & Compliance

* **Threat Detection:** Anomaly detection across logs, network traffic, and auth events.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Scanning repos, containers, dependencies with risk-based prioritization.
* **Policy as Code:** Guardrails for GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA across data flows and CI/CD.
* **Cloud Hardening:** Baselines, IAM least privilege, and continuous posture checks.

### DevOps & Cloud

* **Platform Engineering:** Golden paths, templates, and self-service environments.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Safer deploys with test orchestration, canaries, and rollback hooks.
* **Observability:** Metrics, logs, traces wired to meaningful SLOs and runbooks.
* **Cost Optimization:** Rightsizing, autoscaling, and idle-resource shutdowns.

### Engineering Enablement

* **PR Review Bots:** Automated style/security checks and change-risk scoring.
* **Test Intelligence:** Generative test suggestions & flaky-test isolation.
* **IaC Validation:** Terraform/K8s/Helm linters and policy checks before merge.
* **Developer UX:** Templates, docs, and CLI tooling that speed up delivery.

## Getting Started

* **New client?** Open an issue titled `Discovery: <Company>` with context (systems, goals, timelines).
* **Security review?** Share a read-only repo/cloud view; we’ll return a prioritized risk list.
* **Automation pilot?** Pick 1–2 high-ROI workflows (e.g., PDF → DB, ticket triage) and we’ll ship an MVP in a sprint.
